# DynamicArray-CPP

DynamicArray-CPP is a C++ project that implements a custom dynamic array class using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project provides a range of functionalities for manipulating arrays, such as filling, inserting, deleting, appending, resizing, and merging arrays. It’s an excellent resource for those looking to learn more about data structures, dynamic memory management, and OOP in C++.

## Features

- **Fill Array**: Populate the array with a specified number of elements.
- **Display Elements**: Print the current array contents to the console.
- **Get Size and Length**: Retrieve the array's total capacity (size) and the number of currently stored elements (length).
- **Search for Elements**: Locate an element in the array and return its index.
- **Append**: Add new elements to the end of the array if there’s capacity.
- **Insert at Position**: Insert a new element at a specified index, shifting elements as needed.
- **Delete by Index**: Remove an element at a given index and shift subsequent elements.
- **Resize**: Enlarge the array to a specified new size.
- **Merge Arrays**: Combine another array into the current array, increasing its size accordingly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax and OOP concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Youssef-Joee/DynamicArray-CPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd DynamicArray-CPP
    ```

3. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -o dynamic_array main.cpp
    ```

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./dynamic_array
    ```

## Usage

Follow the prompts to perform operations on the array, such as filling elements, displaying the array, searching, appending, inserting, deleting, resizing, and merging with another array.

### Example

```plaintext
Enter Array Size? 5
How many items you wanna fill? 3
Enter element No. [0] ? 10
Enter element No. [1] ? 20
Enter element No. [2] ? 30

Display Array Content
10   20   30
